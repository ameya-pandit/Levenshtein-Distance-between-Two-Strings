Can run the code in the following two ways: 

1) % make edit_distance
./edit_distance string1 to string2 

User input string1 and string2. You driver will print out the value of edit
distance and the edit table as follow:

% ./edit_distance algorithm to analysis
Edit Distance: 24

right           analysi*thm                     0       16
delete          analysi*hm                      2       18
delete          analysi*m                       2       20
replace by s    analysis*                       4       24

2) % make edit_distance
./edit_distance filename

User provides an input file "filename", which is organized as described in the
problem. You driver reads the file and prints out the edit distance as follow:

% ./edit_distance input1
Edit distance: 100

There is only one line in the output.
